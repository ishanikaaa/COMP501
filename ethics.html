<p style="color:#274020;"><b>Luke's Ethical Refelection: </b>As with many other ethical issues, it can be difficult to justify condemning one group of people, in this case, those employed in agriculture, for the benefit of society. Considerations must be made regarding if the implementation of automation, and how it may displace people, both geographically and regarding their professions and income. If such an implementation were to go through, resources must be provided to ease the process for those affected, such as providing training to work in different fields, or in the new, more specialised roles in agriculture provided by automation. There is also the geographical shift that must be considered, as inevitably people no longer able to keep their old jobs would move to find new work, likely to cities. This could cripple small townships and communities, as well as put stress on the infrastructure of cities experiencing a rush of new demand from more people. While it could be easy to dismiss these issues as temporary displacements for long term benefit, long lasting resentment towards the people pushing for automation as well as the systems of automation themselves, could occur. On the other hand, the benefits to people in the form of lower food prices, as well a reduced impact of the environment, are significant, and raise the issue of not conducting these changes as immoral in their own way.</p>
<p style="color:#274020;"><b>William's Ethical Reflection: </b>Agricultural automation is advancing quickly, and this has several ethical complications that should be carefully considered. On one side, automation can increase productivity, decrease labor intensive jobs, and potentially resolve issues with food security. However, there are concerns about how this would affect farm workers, whose jobs might be automated and cause unemployment and socioeconomic inequality. Care must be taken to guarantee that automation does not risk the wellbeing of farm animals and people. The treatment and wellbeing of animals in automated farming systems are topics of ethical concerns which emphasize the need for putting safety measures in place to avoid any unnecessary injury. Additionally, it is important to consider any potential environmental effects of increased automation, such as an overreliance on chemical inputs, carbon emitted in production and in use, and the excessive consumption of fuel resources. Negating as much of these negative effects will in turn create sustainability in the application of automations agriculture and society. To maintain sustainable and ethical farming practices in the future, it is essential to find a balance between the advantages of automation and its ethical risks.</p>
<p style="color:#274020;"><b>Ishanika's Ethical Reflection: </b>As agricultural automation further advances upon our farming industries, there are various controversies which should be considered with the implications of automation for our agricultural industries. When incorporating machinery like this, there must be a balance for it to work effectively and efficiently as well as being ethical towards the people and wildlife it effects. The advent of this technology presents both incredible and substantial risks leaving us with important choices to make. The benefits of these implementations suggest positive impacts towards our climate as well as the decrease of heavy labor jobs, however, reducing these jobs can pose a great challenge for agricultural workers in small towns as they rely on these jobs to sustain them and their families so that they donâ€™t have to commute to far cities. On one hand, automation can revolutionise farming practices by increasing efficiency and ready heavy labour work thus improving productivity. Food scarcity is another potential challenge alongside the environmental impacts. It is also significant to consider that although it suggests a positive impact towards our climate, it can also be a challenge as well. Carbon emissions as well as the chemicals excreted from these automated machines could result in severe consequences for wildlife as well as the local atmosphere.  There must be strict safety measures set in place for automation to be cautiously integrated into agriculture. It must be become recognisable that these ethical implementations are inherent in these transformations. When evaluating these implications, frameworks such as maximising social well-being including economic prosperity and environmental sustainability, the code of ethics must be considered. The code of ethics is crucial as it guides to navigate the challenges posed by automation in agriculture, ensuring that the choices we make lead to a future that is efficient and ethically and sustainably responsible. </p>
