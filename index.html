<h1 style="color:#729569;">Agriculture and Automation: Future Impact</h1>

<p style="color:#274020;"><b>Introduction</b></p>

<p style="color:#274020;">We dwell upon an evolving society where the arrival of automation gradually pervades various domains, noticeably in the world of agriculture, 
propelling the gradual displacement of human labour. Introducing automation into agriculture is significant as it can prove to be beneficial 
and detrimental simultaneously. Automations implementation can be undertaken to ideally maximise the efficiency of the automation as well as 
providing other benefits, while minimising risks and negative consequences. There are a diverse number of benefits and concerns that come with 
automation being implemented in agriculture globally, however, there are specific challenges have arisen amongst the unique agricultural 
sector in New Zealand. With many supporting the implementation, and many opposed, understanding the depths and concerns of both perspectives 
is significant when discussing this topic as it helps visualise the far-reaching impacts on our society, whether it be positive or negative.</p> 

<p style="color:#274020;"><b>Topic 1: Benefits and issues with automation</b></p>
<p style="color:#274020;">Automating many processes that require human interaction within agriculture will free up a significant portion of people allowing for a 
transfer of human labour towards other sectors resulting in a net gain of productivity across New Zealand's economy. Although this may be a 
good thing, it will also create several issues. One issue that people fear is the process of automation itself, and more succinctly, the 
displacement of people and communities totally geared towards agriculture being unwillingly compelled to learn new skills to retain their 
place in the agricultural workforce, or transfer to different fields of work. With the effects of climate change, we experience more radical 
shifts in seasons, extreme climates, heavy rains and droughts which are very unfavourable conditions for effective agriculture (Bechar, 2021). 
This gives farmers less time to grow crops and provide for their livestock resulting in lower overall production. Additionally, the risk of 
failed harvests remains ever-present, and will become an increasingly common issue. With efficient use of automation and dynamic AI systems, 
recovery and production of crops can prove to be effective when met with unfavourable and unforeseen conditions.</p>

<p style="color:#274020;"><b>Topic 2: Sustainability and Efficiency</b></p>
<p style="color:#274020;">When maximising the use of automations in agriculture, sustainability and efficiency are major factors for the longevity of the farms and automation.
 Sustainability and efficiency in agricultural automation can be viewed as an automated machine or system capable of functioning at maximum efficiency and low cost, either through 
 low resource consumption to produce the automation, or low use of resources such as power, and land space, to maintain crops. By having sustainable and efficient agricultural 
 automation, there is a potentially higher yield in produced or harvested material at a lower cost; therefore, greatly benefiting the user of the automation and the consumer of 
 the goods through lower production cost leading to lower market prices for the consumer. Although there are some successful mechanization and automation in crop harvesting, is 
 still the challenge of minimizing human labour and achieving energy, economic and environmental sustainability (2021). When making an autonomous system or machine, it is 
 ultimately a balancing act where investing resources into developing one element of the automation means sacrificing resources from the other elements. </p>
<p style="color:#274020;">New Zealand is experiencing higher average temperatures and is predicted to become warmer as the years come therefore affecting New Zealand’s agriculture focused 
economy (StatsNZ, 2020). 
<p style="color:#274020;">Automation in the fishing industry is not prevalent, but using automation in fisheries will help with making the job safer especially in extreme 
weather conditions that is now more common
 making the efficiency and sustainability of the automation extremely important. New Zealand has set a goal to reduce net carbon emissions to 50% by 2030, meaning buildings, machines, 
 and vehicles will have guidelines to be more sustainable meet the carbon emission goals (Climate Action Tracker, 2023). To maximise these automations in New Zealand, first step would be 
 to produce a machine that is able to be sustainable and functional for New Zealand’s agricultural methods. This involves creating and testing these automations on New Zealand agriculture. 
 If automations can be created through a sustainable method, then comes the challenge of making the product more sustainable during its use. Adding longevity to the product through thorough 
 engineering and research will be mandatory for the efficiency and overall effectiveness of the automation.</p>
 

<p style="color:#274020;">To achieve efficiency with the automation, there must be minimal human interaction and interference in the automation process. Efficiency will come from a balance of well written software 
and proper engineering of the automation hardware. Using Deep learning neural networks for object detection and autonomous navigation are methods that have been tested and researched 
in the agricultural space with positive results and advantages. By training these autonomous systems through deep learning, feeding the system a large and specific dataset will allow f
or the system to see crops like how farmers would creating a much more reliable system to tend and harvest crops without human intervention (Brassi et al., 2022). Pairing deep learning 
with autonomous navigation where the system uses knowledge from the giving dataset and advance GPS capabilities, the automation can ultimately navigate and identify objects and crops 
at a reasonable accuracy. If the automation is well engineered when working in tandem with the other autonomous systems, it is likely that mechanization of farms can increase productivity 
and profitability as well as agricultural production allowing for greater economic and agricultural gain while also reducing the need for human labour (Jose et al., 2022). Multiple studies 
conclude that “mechanization has increased profitability as well as agricultural production with relation to better quality of work done” making the process of automation a potential net 
positive (Jose et al., 2022). An example of the study shows that animal powered mechanizations “98 kg/ha and 362 kg/ha increase in maize and rice yields, while tractor-powered mechanization 
has improved with 487 kg/ha and 677 kg/ha” showing an improvement of 496% and 187% respectively (Jose et al., 2022).</p>

<p style="color:#274020;"><b>Topic 3: Society’s perspective on automation</b></p>

<p style="color:#274020;">In terms of public perception on implementing automation, specifically in agriculture, there are generally two extremes that people can fall on or between. On one hand, 
automation would lead to a loss of jobs and livelihoods for people employed in the sector and could be perceived as a ploy by companies to reduce the cost of wages for 
labour, purely out of greed. Such job loss would also lead to people being displaced, and small communities being disrupted, purely for profits. Generally, these opinions 
are held by those whose livelihoods would be directly impacted by such a change, that being farmers and members of farming communities. On the other hand, others see it as 
an inevitability brought on by the continuous progression of technology and its implementation in every facet of society. Additionally, such cost saving measures could also 
be perceived as a way to provide the products of agriculture, primarily foodstuffs, at a lower market price, easing the financial burden of food for the consumer. Both opinions 
provide arguments that should not be simply dismissed, and the concerns of all parties must be considered before steps are taken that may change people's lifestyles.</p>

<p style="color:#274020;"><b>Topic 4: Future proofing using agricultural automation</b></p>
<p style="color:#274020;">A significant concern when it comes to automation is how it would perform long term. Questions could be raised about its economic viability, and its impact on global economics. 
Agricultural automation is likely to be a potential method of future proofing agriculture in New Zealand by providing and improving productivity and sustainability of the sector (Bechar, 2021). 
By making use of precision and autonomous systems, the agricultural industry can optimise resource utilisation and minimise unnecessary waste. Autonomous monitoring of livestock provides 
great benefits economically and greatly increases productivity. By having sustainable and efficient automations can contribute to environmental sustainability by reducing chemical and energy 
consumption; therefore, also providing a much safer alternative to exposing workers to harmful chemicals and use of pesticides.</p>

<p style="color:#274020;"><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p style="color:#274020;">Agricultural automations can provide great benefits in creating safer work environments and more efficient methods of harvest in the agricultural sector 
in a sustainable way. New Zealand's adoption of agricultural automation has enormous potential to safeguard the agricultural industry for the future. Automation has both advantages 
and disadvantages, but it's important to comprehend the depths and issues raised by either viewpoint. By maximising resource utilisation and minimising waste, automation can result 
in greater production, efficiency, and sustainability. Additionally, it can assist farmers in adjusting to the effects of climate change and severe weather. The necessity for reskilling 
and switching to other professions must be addressed, along with worries about job displacement and the effect on neighbourhood communities. Furthermore, long-term success depends on adopting 
sustainable automation practises that complement New Zealand's agriculture practises and environmental objectives. The agriculture sector may be made more efficient by balancing automation and human labour.
