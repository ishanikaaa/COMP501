<p style="color:#274020;">When making an autonomous system or machine, it is a balancing act where investing resources into developing one element of the automation means sacrificing resources from the other elements. During such a transition, it is feasible that there will be gaps in production caused by the construction of new systems and the decommissioning of old ones. If not handled correctly, these gaps could lead to shortages in product, negative effects on both the consumers finances, as well as the publics opinion on the change. Another consideration to be made is the speed of implementation. A faster conversion to automation would start providing benefits almost immediately but could cause more disruption to those most likely to be directly negatively affected. A rapid surge of job loss and the subsequent ripple effects would have long reaching consequences, and cause a significant backlash. Alternatively, a slow rollout would avoid, or at least soften the blow of these negative effects. However, this would lead to a lengthy and potentially more costly change, that would delay the positive effects and potentially cause a loss of confidence in concerned parties over the lack of immediate results. Of course, this is all assuming the choice is made to implement automation into agriculture in the first place. </p>
