<p style="color:#274020;">Automating many processes that require human interaction within agriculture will free up a 
significant portion of people allowing for a transfer of human labour towards other sectors resulting in a net gain of
 productivity across New Zealand's economy. With the effects of climate change, we experience more radical shifts in seasons, 
 extreme climates, heavy rains and droughts which are very unfavourable conditions for effective agriculture (Bechar, 2021). 
 This gives farmers less time to grow crops and provide for their livestock resulting in lower overall production. New Zealand 
 has set a goal to reduce net carbon emissions to 50% by 2030, meaning buildings, machines, and vehicles will have guidelines to 
 be more sustainable meet the carbon emission goals (Climate Action Tracker, 2023). To maximise these automations in New Zealand, 
 first step would be to produce a machine that is able to be sustainable and functional for New Zealandâ€™s agricultural methods. 
 This involves creating and testing these automations on New Zealand agriculture. If automations can be created through a sustainable
 method, then comes the challenge of making the product more sustainable during its use. additionally, the risk of failed harvests remains 
 ever-present, and will become an increasingly common issue. With efficient use of automation and dynamic AI systems, recovery and production
 of crops can prove to be effective when met with unfavourable and unforeseen conditions. By having sustainable and efficient agricultural 
 automation, there is a potentially higher yield in produced or harvested material at a lower cost, therefore greatly benefiting the user of
 the automation and the consumer of the goods via lower production cost and therefore lower market prices for the consumer.</p>
