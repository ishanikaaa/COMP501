<p style="color:#274020;"><b>What is agriculture?</b></p>

<p style="color:#274020;"><em>Agriculture is defined as "the science or practice of farming, including cultivation of
the soil for the growing of crops and the rearing of animals to provide food, wool,
and other products".
Agriculture is key to the function of society. The effects of climate change make
ideal conditions for the growth of crops and farms to be much rarer effectively
reducing the production of food and resources.</p></em>

<p style="color:#274020;"><b>What is automation?</b></p>

<p style="color:#274020;"><em>Automation is defined as "the use or introduction of automatic equipment in a
manufacturing or other process or facility".
Introducing automation into agriculture is significant as it can prove to be beneficial
and detrimental at the same time. Ideally maximising efficiency of the automation
and minimising risks. We chose this topic to understand the depths of both
perspectives and visualise possible impacts on our society, whether it be positive or
negative.</p></em>





<p style="color:#274020;">Automations implementation can be undertaken to ideally 
maximise the efficiency of the automation as well as providing other benefits, while minimising risks and negative consequences. There are a diverse number of benefits 
and concerns that come with automation being implemented in agriculture globally, however, there are specific challenges have arisen amongst the unique agricultural 
sector in New Zealand. With many supporting the implementation, and many opposed, understanding the depths and concerns of both perspectives is significant when discussing 
this topic as it helps visualise the far-reaching impacts on our society, whether it be positive or negative. Because of the multi-faceted nature of this issue, there are
 many different approaches that can be taken to implement automation in New Zealand's agricultural sector, as well as many ethical considerations to be weighed against
 each other.</p>
